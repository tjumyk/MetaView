# MetaView

 MetaView is a non-linear video summarization and browse system written in JavaFx 8. It was the graduation project developed for my Bachelor degree in Tianjin University in 2014.

 This project should be a good template project for writing any JavaFx application, because the source code is organized in a proper manner and well-documented, and some useful code patterns, auxiliary functions and even tricky hacks are exhibited for making a full-fledged JavaFx GUI application.

 However, JavaFx and some related 3rd party libraries have been evolved swiftly, new code patterns and better usages of JavaFx API may emerge. Also, for highly-interactive applications like games, it will be even harder and more code patterns should be considered. So this project is just a starting point rather than a complete example.

## Development Requirements

    The following requirements are copied from the original documentation, so some statements within them could be outdated now.

1. Eclipse Kepler SR2+
2. JDK 8.0+ ("JRE System Library" in the build path of the project should be configured well)
3. Eclipse Java8 support plugin (Search "java8" in Eclipse MarketPlace, may be self-included in newer Eclipses)

Additional tools for packaging & deployment:

1. Ant 1.9.3+ (Need to be configured in Prefrences of Eclipse)
2. Inno Setup 5+ (The main folder containing "iscc.exe" need to be added in the system PATH)
